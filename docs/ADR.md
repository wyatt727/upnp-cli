# Architectural Decision Records (ADR)

This document tracks key architectural decisions made during the development of the UPnP CLI project.

## Cursor Rules Applied

The following cursor rules were followed during the CLI modularization:

1. Always use codebase_search with target directories to first to find existing core/relevant files.
2. Always keep track of all architectural decision records in the lightweight document /docs/ADR.md.
3. Always check existing system files purposes before creating new ones with similar functionality.
4. Always list the cursor rules you're using.
5. Never add features which weren't explicitly asked for, to avoid "feature-creep".
6. Always adhere to best practices for clarity, maintainability, and efficiency, as appropriate to the specified language or framework.
7. Always add debug and error logging to your code to quickly identify errors.
8. Always use python3.11

## ADR-013: Device Discovery Deduplication Implementation

**Date:** 2024-12-05  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Context:** Discovery process was returning massive numbers of duplicate devices (108 devices with many exact duplicates) due to multiple SSDP responses per device and multiple attempts to fetch device descriptions from the same endpoints.

**Decision:**
- Implement multi-level deduplication in the discovery pipeline:
  1. **SSDP Response Deduplication**: Deduplicate by location URL to prevent multiple SSDP responses for the same device
  2. **Device Description Deduplication**: Create unique device identifiers using UDN, IP:port, or device characteristics
  3. **Port Scan Optimization**: Avoid multiple requests to the same endpoint with different description paths
  4. **Final Deduplication Pass**: Remove any remaining duplicates and merge complementary information

**Implementation:**
- Added `_create_device_identifier()` function that uses UDN (primary), IP:port (secondary), or device characteristics (fallback) to create unique identifiers
- Added `_deduplicate_devices()` function for final deduplication with information merging
- Modified `scan_network_async()` to track seen devices and eliminate duplicates at each phase
- Prefer SSDP discovery method over port scan when both discover the same device
- Added comprehensive debug logging to track deduplication effectiveness

**Results:**
- **Massive Efficiency Improvement**: Reduced discovery results from 108 to 8 devices (92% duplicate elimination)
- **SSDP Optimization**: Reduced SSDP responses from 101 to 8 unique devices
- **Faster Discovery**: Eliminated redundant device description fetches and port scanning

├── fart_loop.py            # Classic fart loop routine (device-optimized)
└── examples/
    ├── template.py         # Template for new routines
```

**Media File Flexibility:**
- **Flexible Media Support**: Routines accept `--media-file` parameter supporting both local files and full URLs
- **Default Behavior**: Defaults to `fart.mp3` but can play any audio file (e.g. `--media-file rickroll.mp3` or `--media-file https://example.com/audio.mp3`)
- **URL Handling**: Automatically detects full URLs vs local files, serves local files via HTTP server
- **Dynamic Metadata**: Generates device-appropriate DIDL metadata based on actual filename/URL

**Device-Specific Optimizations:**

## ADR-015: Comprehensive SOAP Action Discovery from SCPD Files

**Date:** 2024-12-05  
**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED  
**Context:** Current auto-profile generation is incomplete - profiles don't list ALL possible SOAP commands that devices support. The fuzzing process tests only common actions rather than discovering the complete command surface from authoritative SCPD (Service Control Protocol Description) files.

**Problem:** 
- Generated profiles are missing many device capabilities because we only test a limited set of "common" SOAP actions
- SCPD parsing in `_parse_scpd_actions()` is unreliable and fails on namespace/XML structure variations
- Profiles lack complete argument specifications needed for full device control
- Security assessments are incomplete without knowledge of all available attack vectors

**Decision:**
Implement comprehensive SOAP action discovery by treating SCPD files as the authoritative source of device capabilities:

1. **Enhanced SCPD Parsing**: Fix and enhance `_parse_scpd_actions()` function to reliably extract ALL actions from each service's SCPD file
   - Handle XML namespace variations and malformed SCPD files
   - Extract complete action signatures including argument names, directions (in/out), data types, and related state variables
   - Use robust XML parsing with multiple fallback strategies

2. **Complete Service Enumeration**: For each discovered UPnP service, fetch its SCPDURL and parse the complete action inventory
   - Don't rely on testing "common" actions - get the authoritative list from device's own documentation
   - Handle cases where SCPD files use different XML structures or namespaces
   - Validate SCPD URLs and handle HTTP errors gracefully

3. **Comprehensive Profile Generation**: Update profile format to include exhaustive action inventories
   - Store complete action lists with full argument specifications for each service
   - Include argument details (names, directions, data types, allowed values) for accurate SOAP envelope construction
   - Add service-specific metadata like state variables and their ranges

4. **Action Testing & Validation**: Optionally test discovered actions to determine which ones actually work
   - Differentiate between "documented" actions (from SCPD) and "working" actions (tested successfully)
   - Provide confidence ratings for each action based on SCPD completeness and test results
   - Handle authentication requirements and error responses appropriately

5. **Enhanced Profile Output**: Generate profiles that enable complete device control and security assessment
   - Include exhaustive action lists that reveal full attack surface for penetration testing
   - Provide argument specifications so users know exactly how to craft SOAP envelopes
   - Add metadata about discovery confidence, testing results, and potential security implications

**Implementation Status:**
1. ✅ **Enhanced SCPD Parser** - Implemented comprehensive SCPD parsing in `upnp_cli/profile_generation/scpd_parser.py`
2. ✅ **Complete Service Enumeration** - `parse_device_scpds()` fetches and parses ALL SCPD files systematically
3. ✅ **Comprehensive Action Extraction** - Extract every action with complete argument lists via `SOAPAction` class
4. ✅ **State Variable Resolution** - Resolve argument data types from state variables automatically
5. ✅ **Mass Analysis** - `generate_comprehensive_action_inventory()` for bulk device analysis
6. 🔄 **CLI Integration** - Commands ready but pending import system fixes

**Components Delivered:**
- `EnhancedSCPDParser` - Robust SCPD parsing with fallback strategies
- `SCPDDocument` - Complete document representation with actions and state variables
- `SOAPAction` - Detailed action with input/output argument specifications

- **Better Fuzzing**: Security researchers can target every available action, not just guessed ones

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Profiles become truly comprehensive and useful for complete device control
- **Security Assessments**: Penetration testers can see the complete attack surface of devices
- **Generated Profiles**: Profiles will include exact argument specifications for reliable automation
- **Authoritative Source**: Using device's own SCPD files ensures accuracy and completeness
- **Better Fuzzing**: Security researchers can target every available action, not just guessed ones
- ❌ More complex SCPD parsing logic required
- ❌ Additional HTTP requests to fetch SCPD files may slow discovery
- ❌ Need to handle various SCPD XML formats and potential parsing failures

**Success Metrics:**
- Profiles contain 100% of documented SOAP actions for each service
- Action arguments include complete specifications (names, directions, types)
- SCPD parsing success rate >95% across different device manufacturers
- Generated profiles enable successful SOAP envelope construction for all documented actions
